    I think the difference here is, telling upfront what you want.
    Instead of working in chains. Request/response.

    Not: request/modify/alter/alter/response
                   alter/modify/alter


First line, does not tell what must be done.
The code is used, to manually do it. But we want to tell the code
what to do, not do it for them.

JSON.path is a good example. dot-object contains a bit like that,
but not enough.

Components should receive instructions. Maybe by default the answer is
always a keyed object, with findings. always ready for multiple answers.
Every answer is a collection, if there is only one in the collection that's
ok. You ask several questions, so you get several answers back within that
collection. This actually then becomes a query language.
Which I for sure most not re-invent myself :-)

1. I need `network.input`
2. I need the keys for the name
3. and the title or name for the label.
